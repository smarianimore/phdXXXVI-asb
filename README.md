# Exam: quiz

Students enrolled in the course can choose to take the final examination as a quiz.
The quiz will feature **10 questions, 8 in multiple choice form, 2 in open answer** form, to be answered in **30 minutes**.
The quiz yields "success/failure", no numeric score.
*To succeed, students need to correctly answer 4 multiple choices and 1 open answer.*

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the quiz will be held **remotely**.
Accordingly, we will use two tools:
 1. our MS Teams team for a live confernce call during which you MUST keep the mic active, the webcam active, and share your WHOLE screen
 2. the "Quiz" tool of the "Dolly" platform that I normally use for my other teaching duties

Regarding point 2, if you go to page [https://dolly.ingre.unimore.it/2020/course/view.php?id=132](https://dolly.ingre.unimore.it/2020/course/view.php?id=132) you should:
 - be able to "enroll" as guest by using password "Goedel"
 - see an empty section called "[phdXXXVI-asb] Emerging IT technologies: Autonomous Systems and Blockchains" at the very bottom of the page

Please, **if this is not the case**, [contact me](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) asap!
In that empty section will appear the actual quiz when due.

The pool of eligible questions is as follows:

**Multiple choice**
 - Which are the core features defining a software agent?
 - What is theoretical reasoning?
 - What is practical reasoning?
 - Which are the abstractions of the BDI model?
 - Which are the most common agent architectures?
 - Which are the properties that adaptiveness brings to a system?
 - What is a dominant strategy?
