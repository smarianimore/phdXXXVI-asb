# Exam: quiz

Students enrolled in the course can choose to take the final examination as a quiz.
The quiz will feature **10 questions, 8 in multiple choice form, 2 in open answer** form, to be answered in **30 minutes**.
The quiz yields "success/failure", no numeric score.
*To succeed, students need to correctly answer 4 multiple choices and 1 open answer.*

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the quiz will be held **remotely**.
*The exact means and procedure will be communicated as soon as possible.*

The pool of eligible questions is as follows:

**Multiple choice**
 - Which are the core features defining a software agent?
 - What is theoretical reasoning?
 - What is practical reasoning?
 - Which are the abstractions of the BDI model?
 - Which are the most common agent architectures?
 - Which are the properties that adaptiveness brings to a system?
 - What is a dominant strategy?
 - What are zero-sum games?
 - What is Nash equilibrium?
 - Which are the forms of interaction in a multiagent system?
 - Which are the types of interaction in a multiagent system?
 - What is the core mechanism that makes tuple spaces suitable for coordinating interactions?
 - Which are the existing technologies cleverly combined by the blockchain?
 - What does it mean to mine blocks?
 - Which properties should a digital signature guarantee?
 - Which properties should consensus guarantee?
 - According to FLP theorem, which are the two properties you have to choose amongst in case of failures?
 - According to CAP theorem, which are the two properties you have to choose amongst in case of network partitions?
 - What is eventual consistency?
 - What is a Byzantine failure?
**Open questions**
 - What is the intentional stance?
